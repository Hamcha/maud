Fork of [hoisie/mustache](https://github.com/hoisie/mustache).

This fork is purpose-specific (for [maud](https://github.com/Hamcha/maud)), feedback is appreciated but what's gone is gone.

TODO:

- Remove unneeded stuff (ie. partials)
- Add loop indexes
- (Optional) Dot notation support, one that works with structs
