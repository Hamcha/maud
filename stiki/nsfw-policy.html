<h2 class="thread-title"><a href="/stiki" class="noborder">NSFW Policy</a></h2>
<div>
    <p>(Refer to <a href="https://crunchy.rocks/thread/Wg">this thread</a>).</p>
    <p>In order to be able to keep a "SFW version" of this site, please
    be sure to post any NSFW content under the <a href="https://crunchy.rocks/tag/nsfw">#nsfw</a> tag.
    This means you should either reply to a thread with the #nsfw tag when posting such content
    or, if creating a new thread, put the #nsfw tag among the thread tags.</p>
    <p>You <em>may</em> post a link to a NSFW resource in a thread without the #nsfw tag, but
    in this case you must highlight that the link is NSFW, for example:</p>
    <pre style='text-align:center'>{NSFW}http://link-to-nsfw-content.com/</pre>
    <p>However, it's preferrable to avoid this and just post under the appropriate threads.</p>
    <p>Should you see NSFW content under a thread without the #nsfw tag, please report the
    problem to an admin so that the #nsfw tag may be added to the thread.</p>
    <p>Following these simple rules allows the "Safe Mode" button to have some utility.</p>
