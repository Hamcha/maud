<h2 class="thread-title">NSFW Policy</h2>
<p class="thread-content">
    (Refer to <a href="https://crunchy.rocks/thread/Wg">this thread</a>).
    In order to be able to keep a "SFW version" of this site, please
    be sure to post any NSFW content under the <a href="https://crunchy.rocks/tag/nsfw">#nsfw</a> tag.
    This means you should either reply to a thread with the #nsfw tag when posting such content
    or, if creating a new thread, put the #nsfw tag among the thread tags.
    <br/>
    Should you see NSFW content under a thread without the #nsfw tag, please signal the
    problem to an admin so that the #nsfw tag may be added to the thread.
    <br/>
    Following these simple rules allows the "Safe Mode" button to have some utility.
