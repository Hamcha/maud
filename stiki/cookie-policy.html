<div class="thread-content">
    <p>In order to provide additional features, crunchy.rocks uses cookies and localStorage to store information about particular user settings or information.<br /></p>

    <p>None of our cookies come from external sources (such as advertising or analytics services) or are used for tracking users in any way.<br /><br /></p>

    <p>We use cookies (or localStorage) for:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Saving and providing the backend with the user settings in the OPTION menu (such as all-anons);</li>
        <li><b>&#10033;</b> Saving whether the user wishes to use the "Enhanced security" mode.</li>
        <li>Saving the autogenerated tripcode of the latest anonimous post so that the user can edit it without actually requiring to use a tripcode;</li>
        <li>Saving the latest post visited in a thread, if the option is enabled by the user;</li>
        <li><b>&#10033;</b> Hiding threads from the homepage and other thread lists;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please note that most of those features are available by using localStorage, which is never sent to our server (instead all the work is done via the user's browser), only those with a <b>&#10033;</b> sign are implemented with cookies and therefore sent to us (because we need to serve different content in those cases).<br /></p>
