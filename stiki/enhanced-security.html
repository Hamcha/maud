<div class="thread-content">
    <p>To protect the privacy of our users we now offer the possibility of forcing all images to be loaded from a local SSL proxy to avoid leaking browsing history to other websites.<br /><br /></p>

    <p>In addition to the added security, images will be also be pre-scaled to their thumbnail size before being downloaded, preventing annoying reflows during the loading of a thread.<br /><br /></p>

    <p>You can verify that enhanced security is enabled by looking for the following symbol just below the website's header: <div style="display: inline; font-size: 1rem;color: lightgreen;">&#x1f512; &#x2705;</div>.<br /><br /></p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> Enhanced security mode might make some threads take more time to load because the server has to fetch all the images in order to serve them from a trusted location (this should happen only the first time a page is visited; subsequent requests will be fast).<br /></p>
