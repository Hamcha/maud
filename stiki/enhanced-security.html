<div class="thread-content">
    <p>To protect the privacy of our users we now offer the possibility of forcing all images to be loaded from a local SSL proxy to avoid leaking browsing history to other websites.<br /></p>

    <p>In addition to the added security, images will be also be pre-scaled to their thumbnail size before being downloaded, preventing annoying reflows during the loading of a thread.<br /><br /></p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> Enhanced security mode might make some threads take more time to load because the server has to fetch all the images in order to serve them from a trusted location (this should happen only the first time a page is visited; subsequent requests will be fast).<br /></p>
